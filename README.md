The proposed bicycle loan system is designed to provide a seamless user experience for renting bikes. This application is developed using React,
a popular frontend library, and Node.js, a powerful backend platform. The application utilizes MySQL, a robust relational database management 
system, to store and manage user data and rental history. The application will allow users to browse and select bikes based on location and 
availability, and make reservations using Bike ID. The system will also include Unique ID to every user which features to ensure a smooth rental 
experience for the client. The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with an emphasis on responsive design and accessibility. 
With this application, bike rental companies will have a modern and efficient tool to manage their operations and serve their customers.

The files that the client folder contains in a React.js bike rental application in a frontend React.js application include:

       •	public/index.html: This is the HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application. It may contain a basic HTML structure and a <div> element with             an ID that the React application will render into.
       •	src/index.js: This is the JavaScript file that serves as the entry point for the React application. It typically imports the necessary dependencies, sets up           the root component of the application, and renders it into the DOM.
       •	src/App.js: This is the main component of the application that defines the overall structure and layout of the user interface. It may contain child            components that represent different parts of the application, such as a header, footer, and main content area.
       •	src/components/: This is a directory that may contain various reusable components that are used throughout the application. These components may represent      individual UI elements such as buttons, forms, or cards.
       •	src/pages/: This is a directory that may contain individual pages of the application, each of which may have a different URL and represent a different part of the application. For example, there might be a HomePage component that shows a list of available bikes, and a BookingPage component that allows users to make a reservation.
       •	src/assets/: This is a directory that may contain various static assets used in the application, such as images, fonts, or stylesheets.
       •	src/utils/: This is a directory that may contain various utility functions or modules that are used throughout the application. For example, there might be a api.js module that handles communication with the backend API.
       •	package.json: This file contains various metadata about the project, as well as a list of all the dependencies required to run the application.
       •	node_modules/: This is a directory that contains all the dependencies listed in package.json.



The files that the server folder contains in a Node.js bike rental application in a backend Node.js application include:

       •	app.js or index.js: This is the main entry point of the application that initializes the server and routes incoming requests to the appropriate handlers.
       •	package.json: This file contains metadata about the Node.js application, including its dependencies and other important information.
       •	node_modules: This folder contains all the dependencies (libraries) required for the application to run.
       •	config: This folder contains configuration files for the application, such as settings for the database, API keys, and other environment variables.
       •	controllers: This folder contains the business logic of the application, such as functions for handling requests and interacting with the database.
       •	models: This folder contains the data models for the application, which define the structure and behavior of the data stored in the database.
       •	routes: This folder contains the API endpoints of the application, which define how the server will handle incoming requests and respond with appropriate data.
       

       •	The .env file contains the environment variables.
       •	The .gitignore file lists the files and folders that should not be tracked by Git.
       •	The package.json file lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
       •	The README.md file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and other important information.
